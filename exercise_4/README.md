The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- understand the architecture of **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** and how they operate on sequences by sharing weights over time
- understand the difference between vanilla RNNs and **Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)**
- understand how to **sample from an RNN at test-time**
- understand how to combine convolutional neural nets and recurrent nets to implement an **image captioning system**
- understand how a trained convolutional network can be used to **compute gradients** with respect to the input image
