- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier
- implement and apply a **Two layer neural network** classifier
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)

### 1_softmax.ipynb

The IPython Notebook `softmax.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

### 2_two_layer_net.ipynb

The IPython Notebook `two_layer_net.ipynb` will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### 3_features-optinal.ipynb

The IPython Notebook `features.ipynb` will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.
